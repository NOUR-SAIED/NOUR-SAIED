# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nour Saied

Iâ€™m a Data Engineering student with a strong interest in deep learning, Machine learning and Data pipelines. I have a solid understanding of topics like model training, feature engineering, and working with high-dimensional, real-world data.

My focus is on building intelligent systems that can process and learn from complex data â€” particularly in the context of voice, sound, and language. I'm also exploring scalable data workflows and tools used in modern data engineering.

Always curious, always learning â€” especially when it comes to applying AI to meaningful problems.
